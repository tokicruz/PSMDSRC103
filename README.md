# PSMDSRC103

A stash of all my coding adventures -- whether genius or a bit messy -- as I navigate programming remedials on my quest for a data science PSM!

Here's more about me --

Nickname's Toki -- yes, that jeepney route in UP. I'm political economist, mostly working on policy research, advocacy strategy, and project management for a foreign mission based in Manila.  I’m a strong advocate for evidence-based policymaking, and I’m on a mission to dive into diverse research approaches, triangulate findings, and sharpen policy recommendations that truly make a difference. By blending data science with policy making, I aim to bring a new level of rigor and insight to the decisions that shape our world.
